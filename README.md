# Flight Planner

This project simulates a flight planning system between cities using graph algorithms. It finds the most optimal flight paths based on user preferences for cost or time.

## Features

- Reads flight data from `inputFlights.txt`
- Reads user requests from `inputReqFlights.txt`
- Builds a directed graph with cities as nodes and flights as edges
- Uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest/cheapest path

## Input Format

### inputFlights.txt


## Technologies Used

- Java
- Custom Graph Implementation
- Dijkstra's Algorithm

## How to Run

1. Compile:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
2. Run:
   java src.FlightPlanner
